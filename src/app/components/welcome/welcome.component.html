          Whether its a birthday, Christmas, graduation, wedding, or something else, there are many occaions
          where gifts are given. For various reasons those giving the gifts may not know what 
          the person asking for gifts may want or need. Wish lists and registries provide a method of sharing these needs
          however they often require the gifts to be on the hosting website and ruin the surprise in that those setting up
          the list can see what has been purchased.

            This website is different. Simply set up an account, add your presents, and let people know where they can see
            the list of present ideas. Others can mark presents as purchased but you will not see which gifts are 
            purchased and which are not.No more duplicate gifts, stressed out family, or presents that you have no use of.
